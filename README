Trunkfish is a script that will create periodic backups from the machine executing it onto a separate machine. It was explicitly developed for backing up OSX machines onto a DroboFS, but, with some minimal work, should work for backing up any posix device onto any other posix device, provided they have the requisite programs.

Trunkfish uses hardlinks to minimize actual used drive space, like Time Machine or rsnapshot.

Trunkfish's advantage over Time Machine is that it does not use a proprietary storage format. Instead it stores a complete snapshot of the backed up directory as loose files that you can navigate without special software. Time Machine required me to start from scratch one too many times on my DroboFS for me to rely on it.

Trunkfish's advantage over rsnapshot is that it does not require running the software on the server ( which is not possible on a DroboFS ), it's much easier to setup, and it uses absolute dates on backups, rather than relative ones.

Another advantage of Trunkfish is that it should be relatively easy code to read and understand how it works.

The downside to Trunkfish is that there's no GUI, and it doesn't account for every usage case, although a goal is to make it as fault-tolerant as possible.

   Files that go with this script:

   trunkfi.sh              -   The main script that does the work.
   trunkfish.cfg           -   The configuration file. You need to edit this file before you run trunkfi.sh.
   find_trunkfi.sh         -   A script to identify when a file was was most recently updated.
   ~trunkfish_excludes.txt -   A temporary txt file that contains rsync filters for the backup.
   ~trunkfish.log          -   A temporary log of the backup events.
   ~trunk_err.log          -   A temporary log of backup errors, if there are any.

   TODO:
        - add a script that unloads and deletes plist
        - merge setup scripts into this one
        - make sure dry run is enforced throughout all scripts
        - require root for setup scripts
